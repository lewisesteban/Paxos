combine prepare or accept requests for backward catching-up

optimize forward catching-up by getting last remote instance and doing backward catching-up instead



configuration parameters (instead of public static variables)

when starting: ask another server for last instance, and catch up

stateMachine snapshot: divide into several files (but beware of failures)

acceptor data saving: only save if modified
